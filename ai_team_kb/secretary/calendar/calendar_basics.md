# Calendar Management Basics

## Purpose
To teach the assistant how to manage an executive’s calendar with precision, clarity, and strategic intent. Calendar management is not only about placing meetings, but about protecting the user’s time, maximizing productivity, and ensuring smooth daily flow.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Calendar Is the Source of Truth
- Everything must be on the calendar: meetings, tasks, prep time, buffers, travel.
- The assistant should treat the calendar as the central nervous system of the user’s day.

### 2. Protect the User’s Time
- Decline or reschedule low-value meetings.
- Create boundaries: no-meeting blocks, focus blocks, daily planning time.
- Avoid last-minute commitments unless truly necessary.

### 3. Prioritize According to User Goals
- Align the schedule with what actually matters.
- High-priority items get the best time slots (morning or peak focus hours).

### 4. Communicate Clearly
- Every meeting invite must include:
  - Title  
  - Purpose  
  - Participants  
  - Link or location  
  - Duration  
  - Prep required  

### 5. Use Buffers Intelligently
- Add 5–15 minute breaks between meetings.
- Add travel time for in-person meetings.
- Add prep time before high-stakes calls.

## Scheduling Best Practices

### Always Include These Details in Invites
- Clear meeting title  
- Agenda or purpose (1–2 lines)  
- Participants (with roles if needed)  
- Video link or physical address  
- Relevant documents or attachments  
- Time zone (especially for cross-team meetings)

### Time Zones
- Convert times automatically.
- Avoid scheduling across time zones without confirming convenience.

### Respecting Energy Levels
- Mornings: strategy, focus work, 1:1s  
- Afternoons: admin, routine meetings  
- Late day: buffer, overflow, communication cleanup  

*(This is adjustable per user’s preferences.)*

## Golden Rules for Calendar Changes

1. **Notify all participants** when rescheduling.  
2. **Offer 2–3 alternative times** when proposing a new slot.  
3. **Apologize for inconvenience** only when the user is at fault.  
4. **Avoid same-day changes** unless urgent.  
5. **Update all links, locations, and attachments** with every change.

## Declining or Rescheduling (Professional Phrases)

### Decline (with tact)
- “Unfortunately, the user is unavailable at that time, but we can offer…”
- “Due to a scheduling conflict, we need to reschedule…”

### Offer alternatives
- “Could we move this to…”
- “Here are some times that might work better…”

### Prioritize prep time
- “The user needs additional preparation for this meeting; may we shift to…”

---

## Buffer Management

### Before the Meeting
- Add 10–15 minutes for:
  - Reviewing notes
  - Setting up tech
  - Mental preparation

### After the Meeting
- Add 10 minutes to:
  - Document next steps
  - Send follow-ups
  - Transition to next task

### Between Meetings
- Avoid stacking meetings unless strategically necessary.

## Calendar Hygiene Checklist

- No empty titles  
- No meetings without purpose  
- No double bookings  
- Add prep time where needed  
- Add travel time  
- Ensure links work  
- Confirm attendees  
- Send reminders 24 hours before important meetings

## When to Ask the User for Clarification

Ask the user if:

- The meeting has unclear purpose  
- The person requesting access is unfamiliar  
- The meeting seems low value or unnecessary  
- Two important events conflict  
- Prep time might be needed  
- The meeting exceeds the user’s “maximum daily meeting limit”

## The Role of the Assistant
A world-class assistant:
- Guards the user’s time like a bodyguard  
- Prepares them for every meeting  
- Ensures meetings are purposeful  
- Makes the calendar predictable and stress-free  
- Anticipates problems before they occur  

In short:  
**The assistant doesn’t just schedule the calendar — they design the user’s day.**
