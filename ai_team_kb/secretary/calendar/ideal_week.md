# Ideal Week Framework

## Purpose
The Ideal Week is a blueprint for how the user *wants* their time to be structured.  
It acts as a weekly template the assistant uses to schedule meetings, focus work, rest, and routines — ensuring the user’s time aligns with their priorities, not random requests.

The assistant uses the Ideal Week to **guide scheduling decisions, protect boundaries, and maintain balance**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Prioritize What Matters Most
- High-value activities get protected time.
- The user’s goals should be reflected directly in their weekly layout.

### 2. Energy-Aware Scheduling
- Match activities to the user’s natural energy cycles.
- Use peak focus times for deep work; low-energy times for admin.

### 3. Consistency Reduces Stress
- Repeating blocks (e.g., “Monday strategy session”, “Friday planning”) create rhythm.
- Predictability improves productivity and reduces decision fatigue.

### 4. Protect Focus Time
- Deep work blocks must be uninterrupted.
- The assistant acts as a gatekeeper for these times.

### 5. Leave Space for Reality
- Include buffers, flex time, and catch-up windows.
- Never overschedule the week.

## Standard Ideal Week Categories

These categories can be customized per user, but they form the default template:

### 1. **Deep Work / Focus Time**
- For strategy, creative work, writing, planning, analysis.
- Preferably in the morning.
- Usually 90–120 min blocks.

### 2. **Meetings & Calls**
- Grouped together to avoid chopping up the day.
- Often mid-day or early afternoon.

### 3. **Admin / Communication**
- Emails, Slack, approvals, reviewing documents.
- Scheduled at low-energy periods.

### 4. **Planning & Review**
- Weekly planning session (Friday or Monday).
- Daily quick review (~10 minutes).

### 5. **Personal Time / Health**
- Lunch breaks, stretching, gym, walking.
- Non-negotiable; treated as appointments.

### 6. **Buffer Blocks**
- Between major tasks or meetings.
- Used for spillover or prep.

### 7. **Learning & Development**
- Used for reading, studying, training, or self-improvement.

## Assistant Rules When Using the Ideal Week

### **1. Default Scheduling Logic**
- Always try to place new meetings into the pre-defined meeting blocks.
- Always protect deep work blocks unless:
  - Urgent
  - Executive-level priority
  - User explicitly overrides

### **2. If a meeting request violates the Ideal Week**
The assistant should:
1. Propose alternative times that fit the template  
2. Explain reason (politely) if declining or redirecting  
3. Only break the template for high-priority meetings  

### **3. Weekly Reset**
Every Friday:
- Review the actual week vs. the Ideal Week
- Identify conflicts or stress points
- Adjust future scheduling rules  

### **4. Daily Check**
Every morning:
- Ensure the day aligns with the Ideal Week as closely as possible
- Fix conflicts, rearrange low-priority items

## Red Flags (Assistant Should Avoid)

- Scheduling back-to-back meetings without buffers  
- Booking over deep work blocks  
- Ignoring lunch or personal time  
- Filling every hour (no breathing room)  
- Adding meetings without clear agendas  

---

## What the Ideal Week Is *Not*
- It is NOT a rigid hour-by-hour cage  
- It is NOT meant to punish flexibility  
- It is NOT a wish-list with no grounding in reality  

It is a **guide**, a **structure**, a **default pattern**.

The assistant uses it to make decisions, protect the user, and create psychological ease.

## Summary
The Ideal Week is the user’s personalized “operating schedule.”  
A world-class assistant:
- Follows it  
- Updates it  
- Protects it  
- And synchronizes the user’s entire life around it

The Ideal Week is how the assistant designs *not just the schedule, but the user’s best version of a week.*
