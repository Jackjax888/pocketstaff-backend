# Meeting Preparation Workflow

## Purpose
To ensure the user enters every meeting fully prepared, calm, and confident.  
A world-class assistant never lets the user walk into a meeting without:
- The right information  
- The right documents  
- The right context  

This workflow standardizes how the assistant prepares for ANY meeting.

---

## Step 1 — Identify the Meeting Type

The assistant determines what the meeting *is*, because preparation depends on category:

### Common Types
- 1:1 check-in  
- Client call  
- Internal team sync  
- Sales/demo call  
- Strategy/planning session  
- Interview  
- Performance evaluation  
- Vendor/partner meeting  
- Creative/brainstorm session  

Each type requires slightly different preparation.

## Step 2 — Gather Essential Information

For ANY meeting, assistant collects:

1. **Purpose**
   - One sentence describing WHY the meeting exists.

2. **Agenda**
   - Even if not provided, assistant drafts a simple one.

3. **Participants**
   - Names, roles, company  
   - Who is leading?

4. **Meeting logistics**
   - Date/time (with time zone)  
   - Location or video link  
   - Duration  
   - Attachments needed

5. **Background context**
   - Past emails  
   - Past meetings  
   - Recent decisions  
   - Notes or docs  
   - Any open action items  

---

## Step 3 — Create a Prep Summary for the User

The assistant compiles a short, clear summary.

### Prep Summary Template

MEETING PREP SUMMARY
Meeting: [Title]
Date/Time: [Date, Time, Time Zone]
Participants: [Names + roles]
Purpose: [One-sentence purpose]
Agenda:

[Item 1]

[Item 2]

[Item 3]

Context You Should Know:

[Key point]

[Key point]

[Key point]

Documents Attached:

[Doc 1]

[Doc 2]

Questions to Ask (optional):

[Question 1]

[Question 2]


Assistant keeps it short and scannable.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm All Documents

Before the meeting, assistant ensures:

- All relevant docs are attached  
- Correct versions (not outdated drafts)  
- Links work  
- File names are clean and consistent  
- PDF format if needed  
- Slides are final  

Nothing is worse than “Where’s the doc?” right before a meeting.

---

## Step 5 — Add Prep Time to the Calendar

Assistant schedules **a prep block** before the meeting:

- 5–15 minutes for small meetings  
- 15–30 minutes for important ones  
- 30–60 minutes for high-stakes (sales calls, investor meetings, negotiations)

Prep time is **non-negotiable**.

---

## Step 6 — Day-Before Audit

Assistant checks:

- No conflicts  
- Link works  
- Agenda is finalized  
- Documents are correct  
- Participants confirmed  
- Travel time added (if in-person)  
- User is reminded of their prep summary  

This should prevent 95% of last-minute crises.

---

## Step 7 — Final Hour Check (Optional for Big Meetings)

If the meeting is important, assistant does a quick check:

- User is not in a previous meeting running late  
- User has the prep summary open  
- User has all required documents  

Optional:  
Assistant sends a short reminder message:

> "Your meeting with [Name] starts in 10 minutes.  
> Agenda and documents are ready. Let me know if you need anything."

---

## Step 8 — After the Meeting

Assistant captures:

- Notes  
- Action items  
- Who is responsible for what  
- Deadlines  
- Follow-up tasks  

Then:

- Sends a summary  
- Updates project trackers  
- Schedules follow-up meetings if needed  

---

## Quality Checklist

A meeting is considered “fully prepared” when:

- User knows the purpose  
- User knows the participants  
- Agenda is confirmed  
- Context is summarized  
- Documents are ready  
- Prep time is blocked  
- Logistics are solid  
- No surprises are left  

---

## Summary
Meeting preparation is not optional — it is strategic.

A world-class assistant:
- Organizes information  
- Reduces stress  
- Anticipates needs  
- Ensures every meeting is purposeful  

Preparation turns meetings from chaos into clarity.
