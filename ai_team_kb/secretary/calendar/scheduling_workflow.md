# Scheduling Workflow

## Purpose
To define the step-by-step process a world-class Executive Assistant follows when scheduling any meeting.  
This workflow ensures:
- Clarity  
- Consistency  
- Professionalism  
- Minimal disruptions  
- Protection of the user’s time  

The assistant uses this workflow every time a scheduling request is received.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the Request

Before scheduling anything, the assistant must confirm:

1. **What is the meeting about?**  
   (Purpose, agenda, goal)

2. **Who needs to be there?**  
   (Participants, roles)

3. **How long should it last?**  
   (Default: 30 min unless otherwise stated)

4. **Preferred timing window**  
   - Morning / Afternoon  
   - Specific day ranges  
   - Direct instructions like “next week” or “ASAP”

5. **Priority level**  
   - *Critical* — schedule ASAP even if it disrupts blocks  
   - *High* — schedule soon but respect Ideal Week  
   - *Normal* — follow default scheduling rules  
   - *Low* — place in low-value meeting windows  

If any of these are unclear → **assistant must ask clarifying questions**.

---

## Step 2 — Check the User’s Calendar

The assistant must evaluate:

- Existing commitments  
- Deep work blocks  
- Buffer times  
- Personal or non-movable events  
- Travel time, if relevant  
- Time zone differences  

### Rules:
- **Never interrupt deep work blocks unless emergency**  
- **Avoid back-to-back meetings without buffer**  
- **Respect the Ideal Week template whenever possible**  

---

## Step 3 — Generate 2–3 Suitable Time Options

After reviewing the calendar, the assistant proposes **high-quality time slots**.

Each option must:

- Fit user’s Ideal Week framework  
- Include buffer before/after  
- Be realistic for all participants  
- Use the correct time zone

Example options format:


If options are limited, assistant explains:  
> “Availability is tight this week, so here are the best fits…”

---

## Step 4 — Contact Participants

### External Scheduling
Use a polite, formal message:
- Introduce yourself  
- State purpose  
- Offer the 2–3 time options  
- Ask for their preferred slot  

### Internal Scheduling
Shorter, semi-formal:
- “Can you make any of these times?”  
- Still include clarity + options  

---

## Step 5 — Confirm the Time

Once a participant selects a time:

- Confirm in writing  
- Update the calendar *immediately*  
- Add location, link, or dial-in  
- Attach relevant documents  
- Add prep time beforehand  
- Add buffer afterward  

---

## Step 6 — Create the Calendar Invite

Every invite **must** include:

- **Clear title**
- **Purpose or agenda (1–2 lines)**
- **Participants**
- **Video link or meeting room**
- **Attachments/documents**
- **Time zone**
- **Who is hosting**

### Example Template

## Step 7 — Notify the User

The assistant briefly updates the user:

- “Your meeting with Sarah is confirmed for Wednesday at 10 AM.  
  I added a 15-minute prep block beforehand and included the proposal draft.”

This keeps the user in the loop without overwhelming them.

---

## Step 8 — Day-Before Check

For important meetings, the assistant performs a “day-before audit”:

- Confirm no conflicts  
- Confirm the meeting link works  
- Ensure attachments are final  
- Remind the user if prep is needed  
- Confirm travel time (if in-person)  

---

## Step 9 — Final Hour Check (Optional)

For critical meetings:

- Ensure user is not in another meeting  
- Remind them of the agenda  
- Bring forward relevant documents  

---

## Rescheduling Protocol

1. Apologize only if it’s the user’s change  
2. Offer 2–3 new times  
3. Notify all participants  
4. Update the invite AND send a confirmation email  
5. Clean up the old time block so no “ghost meeting” remains

---

## Declining a Meeting

Decline when:
- No clear purpose  
- User not essential  
- Conflicts with high-priority focus  
- Poor timing (like late-day Friday for low-value calls)

### Example Decline Message

- Prioritize their goals  
- Maintain clarity  
- Always propose options
