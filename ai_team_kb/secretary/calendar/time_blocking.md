# Time Blocking Framework

## Purpose
Time blocking is the method of assigning specific blocks of time to specific types of work.  
A world-class assistant uses time blocking to:
- Protect focus time
- Reduce context switching
- Group similar tasks together
- Create a predictable daily rhythm
- Ensure high-value work happens consistently

The assistant treats the user's calendar as a design system, not a list of random appointments.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Block = One Type of Task
Avoid mixing different kinds of work in the same block.

### 2. Focus Blocks Come First
High-energy or high-priority tasks get the earliest blocks.

### 3. Meetings Are Clustered
Group meetings together to protect long uninterrupted stretches of time.

### 4. Admin Tasks Go in Low-Energy Periods
Email, Slack, approvals, and small tasks belong in afternoon or low-focus times.

### 5. Breaks and Buffers Are Not Optional
Burnout ruins productivity.
Schedule breathing space.

## Standard Block Types

### **1. Deep Work Block**
- Duration: 60–120 minutes  
- No notifications, no interruptions  
- Used for: analysis, writing, creative work, strategy, planning  

### **2. Admin Block**
- Duration: 30–60 minutes  
- Email, Slack, messages, approvals, small tasks  
- Often placed late morning or late afternoon  

### **3. Meeting Block**
- Duration: flexible  
- Clustered to avoid fragmenting the day  
- Back-to-back if necessary  

### **4. Flex / Overflow Block**
- Duration: 30–60 minutes  
- For unexpected tasks, spillover, or emergencies  

### **5. Prep Block**
- Duration: 10–20 minutes  
- Before big meetings, presentations, or sales calls  

### **6. Recovery Block**
- Walks, lunch, stretching, mental reset  
- Should never be skipped

## Example Daily Structure (Default)

**9:00–11:00** — Deep Work  
**11:00–12:00** — Admin / Communication  
**12:00–1:00** — Lunch / Recovery  
**1:00–3:00** — Meetings  
**3:00–4:00** — Project Work / Flex  
**4:00–4:30** — Wrap-Up / Planning / Last Emails  

The assistant adapts this pattern to individual user preferences.

## Rules for Assigning Blocks

### 1. Always start with Deep Work
Unless the user prefers otherwise.

### 2. Avoid fragmented days
- No alternating meeting > focus > meeting > focus.
- This destroys productivity.

### 3. Protect lunch and breaks
- These are real blocks.
- Never schedule over them.

### 4. One task per block
Even if the user multitasks, the assistant should not.

### 5. Respect transitions
- Add 5–10 minutes between blocks.
- Restore mental clarity before switching modes.

## When the Assistant Should Ask the User

Ask if:
- A meeting conflicts with an existing deep work block
- Daily workload seems unrealistic
- Too many blocks are being used for low-value work
- The user hasn’t had breaks in several hours

## Blocking Techniques the Assistant Uses

### **Pomodoro Blocks**
- 25 min focus + 5 min break
- Good for:
  - Overwhelm
  - Low motivation
  - Large, ambiguous tasks

### **90-Minute Ultradian Rhythm Block**
- 90 min deep focus + 20 min break  
- Matches natural brain cycles

### **Theme Days**
Examples:
- Monday = planning  
- Tuesday = creative  
- Wednesday = calls  
- Friday = review  

### **Batching**
- Group similar tasks:
  - All outgoing emails at once  
  - All design reviews at once  
  - All admin in one block  

---

## Block Placement Guidelines

### Morning (High Energy)
- Deep Work  
- Strategy  
- Complicated tasks  
- Creative tasks  

### Midday
- Meetings  
- Collaboration  
- Calls  

### Late Afternoon
- Admin  
- Wrap-up  
- Follow-ups  
- Light project work

## Signs Time Blocking Is Working

- Fewer last-minute scrambles  
- User feels calmer and more in control  
- Work is finished earlier  
- Fewer fragmented half-days  
- Weekly rhythm feels predictable  

---

## Summary
Time blocking makes the user’s calendar intentional rather than reactive.

A world-class assistant:
- Designs the user’s day  
- Protects focus  
- Reduces chaos  
- Makes time predictable  
- Ensures important work happens  

Time blocking turns time into a design system — and the assistant is the designer.
