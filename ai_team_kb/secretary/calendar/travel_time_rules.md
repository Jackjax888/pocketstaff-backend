# Travel Time Rules

## Purpose
To ensure the assistant schedules realistic, stress-free travel time for the user.  
Travel time includes:  
- Moving between locations  
- Parking and building entry  
- Elevator time  
- Settling in  
- Unexpected delays  

The assistant must ALWAYS account for travel time when scheduling in-person events.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Never schedule meetings back-to-back if travel is required
Even short distances require:
- Packing up
- Leaving the building
- Getting to the next location
- Settling in

### 2. Travel time is real time
It must appear on the calendar as a **dedicated block**, not assumed.

### 3. Add safety buffers
Unexpected delays always happen:
- Traffic  
- Long elevators  
- Parking issues  
- Wrong entrance  
- Security checkpoints  

Buffers prevent stress.

## Standard Travel Time Rules

### **Rule 1: Same Building (Different Floors)**
- Add **10 minutes** for elevator + transition
- If the building is large, add **15 minutes**

### **Rule 2: Walking Distance (0–10 minutes away)**
- Add **10–20 minutes** depending on:
  - Crowds
  - Weather
  - Complexity of building entry

### **Rule 3: Driving (Local, 10–30 min drive)**
- Add **drive time + 15 minutes**
- Includes:
  - Parking
  - Walking in
  - Reception check-in

### **Rule 4: Cross-Town (Busy city)**
- Add **drive time + 20–30 minutes**
- Adjust for:
  - Traffic patterns
  - Time of day
  - Construction zones

### **Rule 5: Airport or Long-Distance Travel**
- Add:
  - **60–90 minutes** pre-flight (domestic)
  - **2–3 hours** pre-flight (international)
- Add buffer for:
  - Security
  - Boarding
  - Gate changes

### **Rule 6: Remote Meetings Immediately After Travel**
- Never allowed **without a buffer**
- Add at least **15–20 minutes** between arrival & video call

## Safety Buffers (Always Add)

- +5 minutes for short moves  
- +10 minutes for meetings requiring setup  
- +15 minutes for unpredictable traffic  
- +20–30 minutes for important meetings (arrive early)  

The assistant should **over-estimate**, not under-estimate.

## How to Add Travel Time to the Calendar

Travel time should appear as a block:

Travel: Office → Client HQ
Time: 12:30–1:00 PM
Notes: 15 min drive + 15 min parking/walking buffer


Or:

Walk: Building A → Building C (Conference Room 14B)
Time: 10:40–10:50 AM


The assistant always makes the notes descriptive.

## When the Assistant Must Ask the User

Ask if:
- Location is unclear  
- User changes their start location  
- Weather is severe  
- Traffic is abnormal (construction, events)  
- User is on foot vs. car vs. ride service  
- Meeting location has strict security  
- There’s a tight schedule between events  

---

## Red Flags (Avoid at all costs)

- Scheduling a call immediately after in-person meeting  
- Ignoring traffic patterns  
- No buffer time  
- Flights + meetings on same day without checking feasibility  
- Assuming the user knows the route  
- Scheduling travel during peak commute times unless necessary  

---

## Good Travel Time Habits for the Assistant

- Add travel time immediately after scheduling an in-person event  
- Double-check **start location** for each meeting  
- Check for **building entry instructions**  
- Add prep time before arrival if needed  
- Add decompression time after long travel  
- Mark travel blocks with clear labels  

---

## Summary
Travel time is part of the meeting —  
**not an afterthought.**

A world-class assistant avoids chaos by:
- Overestimating travel duration  
- Adding buffers  
- Labeling travel clearly  
- Anticipating delays  
- Protecting user comfort and punctuality  

Travel time rules prevent stress and keep the user consistently on schedule.
