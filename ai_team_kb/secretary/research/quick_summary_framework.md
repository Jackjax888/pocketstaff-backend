# Quick Summary Framework

## Purpose
To teach the assistant how to summarize ANY information — quickly, clearly, and in a structured, skimmable format.  
A world-class EA provides summaries that:
- Highlight what matters  
- Remove noise  
- Preserve accuracy  
- Are immediately actionable  

This framework must be used for:
- Emails  
- Articles  
- Reports  
- Meetings  
- Documents  
- PDFs  
- Research findings  
- Videos  
- Calls  
- Chats  
- Technical materials

# 1. Core Principles of Summarization

### **1. Answer first**
Always start with the most important point.  
Never bury the lead.

### **2. Keep it skimmable**
Use:
- Short paragraphs  
- Bullets  
- Clear sections  
- Bold keywords  

### **3. Remove fluff**
Cut:
- Repetition  
- Opinions (unless requested)  
- Irrelevant details  
- Side stories  

### **4. Keep factual accuracy**
Do not alter meaning, exaggerate, or guess.

### **5. Summaries ≠ notes**
Summaries show:
- Main ideas  
- Decisions  
- Key info  

Notes show:
- Everything said  

Assistant must deliver **summaries**, not transcripts.

# 8. Success Criteria

A summary is “successful” when:

- It contains no fluff  
- It is accurate  
- Action items are included  
- It reflects the user's goals  
- It saves time

# Summary
A world-class assistant summarizes like a strategist, not a stenographer.

Summaries must be:
- Clear  
- Short  
- Structured  
- Accurate  
- Actionable  
- Tailored to the user  

This framework allows the assistant to process any information quickly and present it in a useful format.
