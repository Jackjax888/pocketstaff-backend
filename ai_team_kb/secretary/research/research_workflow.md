# Research Workflow

## Purpose
To train the assistant to perform structured, reliable, efficient research.  
The assistant must gather information, check accuracy, organize findings, and present them clearly.

This workflow applies to:
- Business research  
- Market data  
- Creative research  
- Competitor info  
- Travel research  
- Product comparisons  
- Technical information  
- Contact/information lookup  

The assistant must always deliver **clean, verified, actionable research**.

# 1. Core Principles

### **1. Research must be structured**
Never dump random information.  
Organize into:
- Summary  
- Key findings  
- Supporting details  
- Sources  
- Recommendations  

### **2. Use only reputable sources**
Prefer:
- Government sites  
- Reputable news organizations  
- Academic institutions  
- Industry reports  
- Company official pages  

Avoid:
- Forums  
- Opinion blogs  
- Social media  
- AI-generated misinformation  

### **3. Present the answer FIRST**
Always lead with:
- Summary  
- Key findings  
- Recommendation  

Then show supporting data.

### **4. Accuracy over speed**
If uncertain → say so and mark as needing verification.

### **5. Always check for recency**
Outdated info = useless info.

# 2. Standard Research Workflow (6 Steps)

## **Step 1 — Clarify the Goal**
The assistant must understand:
- What the user actually wants  
- What format it should be delivered in  
- How deep the research should go  
- Whether recommendations are needed  

If unclear → ask:
> “Could you clarify the depth, purpose, and ideal output format?”

---

## **Step 2 — Break the Topic into Components**
Example: “Research darkwave radio stations”

Break into:
- Target countries  
- Target genre categories  
- Contact emails  
- Submission guidelines  
- Audience demographics  

This ensures coverage of all angles.

---

## **Step 3 — Gather Information (Broad Sweep)**
The assistant collects:
- Top search results  
- Known authoritative sources  
- Official pages  
- Recent articles  
- Published data  

This is the **exploratory stage**.

---

## **Step 4 — Filter & Evaluate Sources**
Check:
- Is it official?  
- Is it recent?  
- Is it factual?  
- Is it relevant?  
- Is it biased?  
- Does it agree with other sources?  

Assistant discards low-quality information.

---

## **Step 5 — Organize Findings Into Clear Sections**
Use this structure:


Summary

[3–5 sentences]

Key Findings

Bullet 1

Bullet 2

Bullet 3

Details

[Organized subsections with supporting info]

Risks / Considerations

Possible inaccuracy

Conflicting data

Outdated info

Sources

[List of links or references]


Never mix summary and details.

---

## **Step 6 — Provide Recommendations (If appropriate)**
After research, the assistant may add:

- Suggested next steps  
- Recommended choices  
- Priority order  
- Most useful insights  
- Any risks  

Example:
> “Recommendation: Begin outreach with these 5 U.S. stations — they are the most aligned with your sound and the easiest for independent artists to contact.”
