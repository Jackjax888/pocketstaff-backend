# Inbox Zero Workflow

## Purpose
To train the assistant to manage the user's email inbox with clarity, efficiency, and consistency.  
A world-class Executive Assistant ensures:
- No email is forgotten  
- No response is delayed  
- Nothing slips through the cracks  

Inbox Zero does NOT mean “no emails.”  
It means every email is either:
- Dealt with  
- Delegated  
- Deferred  
- Filed  
- Or deleted  

This workflow gives the assistant a reliable, repeatable system.

# 1. Core Principles of Inbox Zero

### 1. Every email must be processed
The assistant never leaves emails sitting without a decision.

### 2. Processing ≠ replying
Processing means deciding “what does this email *mean* and what needs to happen next?”

### 3. Inbox is not a to-do list
Tasks go to the task system.  
Info goes to the knowledge base.  
Emails do NOT just sit there.

### 4. Clarity > Speed
A thoughtful response beats a rushed one.

### 5. Categorize ruthlessly
Every email gets sorted into its proper place.

# 2. The 5 Actions for Every Email (“The 5 Ds”)

When the assistant opens an email, they choose ONE of these:

## **D1 — Delete**
If it’s useless:
- Spam  
- Sales pitches  
- Irrelevant newsletters  

→ Archive or delete immediately.

---

## **D2 — Delegate**
If someone else should handle it:
- Forward  
- Summarize  
- Add a note: “Please handle this.”

→ Add to “Waiting For” list.

---

## **D3 — Do (If under 2 minutes)**
Quick replies such as:
- Confirming a time  
- Approving something simple  
- Sending a link  

→ Reply immediately.
→ Then archive.

---

## **D4 — Defer (Longer than 2 minutes)**
Anything requiring thought, writing, or research:
- Draft for later  
- Turn into a task  
- Schedule it  
- Add reminders  

→ Archive or snooze.

---

## **D5 — Document**
If it's reference material:
- Move to the proper folder  
- Tag it  
- Save attachments  
- Summarize if needed  

→ Archive after storing.

# 3. Email Categories (Assistant Uses Automatically)

The assistant will create and maintain:

### **1. Action Needed**
Emails requiring the user’s attention today or this week.

### **2. Waiting For**
Emails awaiting other people’s responses.

### **3. Follow-Up**
Emails the assistant must revisit if no reply.

### **4. Reference**
Useful information with no action.

### **5. Archived**
Complete or irrelevant items.

# 4. Daily Inbox Zero Routine (Assistant Does This Every Day)

## **Morning Inbox Sweep**
1. Process all unread emails  
2. Capture tasks  
3. Add follow-ups  
4. Categorize everything  
5. Present the user with a short summary:
   > “You have 3 items requiring action today, 2 waiting-for replies, and 1 follow-up from yesterday.”

---

## **Midday Check**
- Look for new urgent items  
- Clear spam & noise  
- Send quick replies  
- Add new tasks as needed  

---

## **End-of-Day Sweep**
- Ensure inbox is cleared  
- Move emails to proper folders  
- Prepare follow-up list for tomorrow  

---

# 5. Follow-Up System

A world-class EA NEVER loses track of follow-ups.

### Assistant Rules:
- If no reply in 48 hours → follow up  
- If time-sensitive → follow up in 24 hours  
- If critical → same-day follow-up  
- Always rewrite follow-ups politely and professionally  

### Example follow-up template:

Hi [Name],
I wanted to follow up on the message below.
When you have a moment, could you please share an update?
Thanks so much,
[Assistant Name]

# 6. Summarizing Emails for the User

Users should not be overloaded with long emails.

Assistant summarizes:
- One-line purpose  
- Key points  
- What decision or action is needed  
- Deadline  
- Recommended response  

### Example:

SUMMARY:
Email from Sarah — requesting revised contract timeline.
Needs your approval on the new dates.

ACTION NEEDED:
Approve or propose changes.

DEADLINE:
Today.


---

# 7. Drafting Emails for the User

The assistant drafts emails in:
- Professional tone  
- Clear structure  
- Polite language  

Must follow rules in `email_etiquette.md`.

---

# 8. Handling Calendaring Emails

If an email contains a meeting request, the assistant:
1. Extracts purpose  
2. Extracts participants  
3. Extracts date/time or preferences  
4. Checks calendar  
5. Suggests 2–3 time options  
6. Sends a clean scheduling email  
7. Updates calendar  
8. Confirms with user  

This is deeply integrated with `scheduling_workflow.md`.

---

# 9. Managing Project-Related Emails

The assistant must:
- Extract tasks  
- Update project trackers  
- Note dependencies  
- File documents  
- Inform the user only when necessary  
- Track all commitments  

---

# 10. Inbox Zero Criteria (When the Assistant Is Done)

Inbox Zero is achieved when:
- No important emails are unread  
- All tasks from emails are captured  
- Follow-ups are scheduled  
- No emails need clarification  
- All reference material is stored  
- Inbox is empty or near-empty  

Empty inbox = clear mind.

---

- Reads every email
