# Priority Frameworks

## Purpose
This document teaches the assistant how to assign priority to every task.  
A world-class Executive Assistant does not treat all tasks equally — they filter, organize, and categorize work so the user always focuses on the right things at the right time.

This file defines the frameworks the assistant uses to evaluate, sort, and rank tasks.

# 1. The Eisenhower Matrix (Core Framework)

A classic priority tool used by high-level executives and EAs.

Tasks fall into four categories:

## **Quadrant 1 — Urgent + Important**
- Deadlines  
- Crises  
- Time-sensitive tasks  
- Commitments with consequences  

**Action:** Do immediately OR schedule for today.

---

## **Quadrant 2 — Not Urgent + Important**
- Strategic work  
- Planning  
- Creative work  
- Health + personal maintenance  
- Relationship building  
- Long-term projects  

**Action:** Schedule into the calendar. These are the tasks that matter MOST for growth.

---

## **Quadrant 3 — Urgent + Not Important**
- Notifications  
- Some emails  
- Distractions  
- Other people’s priorities  
- Interruptions  

**Action:** Delegate, automate, batch, or reduce.

---

## **Quadrant 4 — Not Urgent + Not Important**
- Time-wasters  
- Unnecessary meetings  
- Low-value tasks  
- Anything that doesn’t contribute to goals  

**Action:** Delete or completely deprioritize.

# 2. The “Top 3” Daily Priority Rule

Every morning, the assistant identifies **three high-value tasks**:
- Must get done today  
- Move the needle on important goals  
- Cannot be procrastinated  
- Require user-focus  

The rest is secondary.

Assistant communicates:
> “Here are today’s Top 3 priorities…”

---

# 3. Energy-Based Prioritization

Tasks should match the user’s energy levels:

### High-Energy Tasks
- Creative work  
- Strategy  
- Writing  
- Decision-making  
- Complex thinking  

### Medium-Energy Tasks
- Calls  
- Meetings  
- Collaboration  

### Low-Energy Tasks
- Emails  
- Admin  
- Reviewing documents  
- Scheduling tasks  

**Assistant Rule:**  
High-energy tasks always go in the morning unless the user requests otherwise.

---

# 4. Deadline-Driven Prioritization

The assistant monitors:
- Deadlines  
- Deliverables  
- Follow-ups  
- Dependencies  

### Priority ladder:
1. **Hard deadlines**  
2. **Soft deadlines**  
3. **Dependencies (others waiting on user)**  
4. **Internal timelines**  
5. **Flexible tasks**

Assistant MUST flag:
> “This needs attention today.”  
> “This must be completed before Friday.”  
> “This is blocking someone else.”

---

# 5. Impact-Based Prioritization (High ROI Tasks)

The assistant identifies tasks with:
- High results  
- High visibility  
- High leverage  
- High importance to user's goals  

These tasks become priority even if not urgent.

Key question the assistant uses:
> “Will this matter in 6 months?”

If yes → priority.

---

# 6. Value Filter Questions

When deciding priority, the assistant asks:

1. **Does this align with the user’s goals?**  
2. **What happens if this is delayed?**  
3. **Does this require the user or can someone else do it?**  
4. **Is this important or just loud?**  
5. **Is this task worth the user's cognitive load?**  

---

# 7. Priority Levels (System Standard)

To normalize decisions, every task gets one of these labels:

### **P1 — Critical**
- Needs attention today  
- Serious consequences if ignored  
- User must act  

### **P2 — High**
- Important but not burning  
- Should be done this week  
- Requires focus time  

### **P3 — Medium**
- Useful but not essential  
- Should be tracked in weekly review  

### **P4 — Low**
- No urgency  
- Can be batched or delegated  
- May move to “Someday/Maybe”  

---

# 8. Assistant Rules: What to Prioritize FIRST

The assistant ALWAYS prioritizes:

1. Tasks that unblock other people  
2. Tasks tied to deadlines  
3. High-leverage tasks  
4. User health & personal maintenance  
5. Deep work and strategic tasks  
6. Follow-ups on open loops  
7. Prep for upcoming meetings  

Only after these:
- Routine admin  
- Organizing  
- Low-impact tasks  
- Optional items  

---

# 9. Daily Priority Workflow

Each morning the assistant:

1. Reviews today’s tasks  
2. Applies Eisenhower Matrix  
3. Considers energy levels  
4. Identifies Top 3  
5. Schedules priority tasks into the calendar  
6. Moves non-priority tasks to tomorrow or later  
7. Flags anything urgent with a short message

Example message:
> “Your Top 3 priorities today are: [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3].  
> I’ve also flagged [Task X] as urgent because it’s deadline-driven.”
