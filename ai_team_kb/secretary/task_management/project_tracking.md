# Project Tracking

## Purpose
To teach the assistant how to manage projects end-to-end.  
A “project” is anything with **more than one step** and a clear outcome.

A world-class Executive Assistant ensures:
- Projects stay on track  
- Tasks are completed on time  
- Nothing gets forgotten  
- Stakeholders are aligned  
- The user always knows the current status  

This file defines how the assistant handles all multi-step work.

# 1. What Counts as a Project?

Anything that contains more than one related task.

Examples:
- Launch a product  
- Prepare a presentation  
- Plan a trip  
- Release a new song  
- Organize a photoshoot  
- Negotiate a contract  
- Plan an event  
- Build a website  
- Submit a grant or application  

If it has steps → **it is a project**.

# 2. Project Structure (Assistant Must Use)

Every project must include:

### **1. Project Title**
Clear and specific.

### **2. Goal / Desired Outcome**
One sentence explaining what “done” looks like.

### **3. Tasks / Subtasks**
Breakdown of all steps required.

### **4. Owners**
Who is responsible for each task?
- User  
- Assistant  
- External team  
- Collaborators  

### **5. Deadlines & Milestones**
Hard dates and soft dates.

### **6. Status**
- Not Started  
- In Progress  
- Waiting For  
- Blocked  
- Complete  

### **7. Notes / Context**
Key details, decisions, links, or files.

# 3. Assistant Workflow for Managing a New Project

### **Step 1 — Capture the Project**
Even if user says casually:
> “We should organize a photoshoot sometime.”

Assistant creates a project entry.

---

### **Step 2 — Clarify the Objective**
Ask the user:
- What is the final outcome?
- By when?
- Who is involved?
- What are the constraints?
- What does success look like?

---

### **Step 3 — Break It Down**
Create a clear list of steps.

Example:
**Project: Hire a video editor**
1. Research candidates  
2. Gather samples  
3. Create short test project  
4. Send test to finalists  
5. Evaluate results  
6. Make hiring decision  
7. Send contract  
8. Onboard  

---

### **Step 4 — Assign Owners**
Define:
- What the user handles  
- What the assistant handles  
- What others will contribute  

Assistant assigns tasks automatically when possible.

---

### **Step 5 — Add Deadlines**
Every task needs a time expectation:
- Hard deadlines  
- Soft deadlines  
- Priority tiers  

Projects without dates never move.

---

### **Step 6 — Connect to the Calendar**
For important tasks:
- Add prep blocks  
- Add due dates as events  
- Add follow-up reminders  

Calendar is where project tasks become real.

---

# 4. Tracking Progress

Assistant updates project status daily or weekly depending on urgency.

### The assistant must:
- Mark tasks complete  
- Move tasks to next stage  
- Update “Waiting For” items  
- Add follow-ups  
- Notify the user of blockers  
- Keep everything organized  

---

# 5. Weekly Project Review (Every Friday)

Assistant performs:

1. List all active projects  
2. Review progress on each  
3. Identify delays  
4. Update statuses  
5. Flag high-priority items  
6. Prepare a short summary for the user

### Weekly Summary Template:

Weekly Project Summary

1. Project Name

Status: In Progress

Completed: [Tasks]

Next Steps: [Task 1, Task 2]

Waiting On: [Person/Item]

2. Project Name

Status: Blocked

Reason: Waiting on Mark for approvals

Recommended action: Follow up Monday


Short, clear, useful.

---

# 6. Handling Blocked or Delayed Projects

Assistant must proactively:
- Identify bottlenecks  
- Inform user clearly  
- Suggest solutions  
- Follow up with responsible parties  
- Adjust timeline if needed  

### Example assistant message:
> “The website redesign is delayed because we are waiting for the copy from Sarah. Recommended next step: send a follow-up today.”

---

# 7. Closing Projects

A project is considered complete when:
- All tasks are done  
- Deliverables are sent or published  
- Stakeholders are informed  
- Files are organized archived  
- Knowledge is stored in the knowledge base  

Assistant should send a short “Completed Project Summary.”

---

# 8. Success Criteria

Project tracking is “successful” when:
- No steps are forgotten  
- User always knows the status  
- Deadlines are met  
- Dependencies are monitored  
- Communication is consistent  
- Projects move forward every week  
- Nothing gets stuck without the user knowing  

---
