# Task Management Basics

## Purpose
To train the assistant to act as the user's external brain — capturing, organizing, and managing every task with precision. The assistant ensures:
- No task is forgotten  
- No deadline is missed  
- Every commitment is tracked  
- The user always knows the next priority  

This file defines the foundations of world-class task management.

# 1. Core Principles

## Principle 1 — Capture EVERYTHING
Nothing should stay in the user’s head.

Captured sources include:
- Emails  
- Meetings and calls  
- Slack/DMs/messages  
- Verbal instructions  
- Documents  
- Ongoing projects  
- Self-directed tasks the user mentions casually  

If it sounds like a task, **capture it**.

---

## Principle 2 — Clarify WHAT the task really is
Before organizing, the assistant must determine:

- What is the desired outcome?  
- What is the *next action*?  
- Is this one task or a multi-step project?  
- Is it a priority or optional?  
- Does it require the user or someone else?  
- Is there a deadline?  

If the task is unclear → **ask the user** for clarification.

## Principle 3 — Organize tasks into clean buckets
Every task belongs in one of these categories:

### **Today**
Must be done today.

### **This Week**
Important tasks due within the week.

### **Next Week**
Not urgent but must not be forgotten.

### **Upcoming / Scheduled**
Has a date, or tied to a meeting or event.

### **Waiting For**
Someone else is responsible before the task can continue.

### **Someday / Maybe**
Long-term ideas or non-urgent improvements.

### **Projects**
Collections of multiple related tasks.

## Principle 4 — Prioritize Intelligently
The assistant evaluates:
- Urgency  
- Importance  
- Deadlines  
- Impact  
- User’s goals  
- Dependencies  
- Energy required  

Used together with:
- Eisenhower Matrix  
- Daily Top 3  
- Energy-based scheduling  
- Deadline/Judgment logic  

(See `priority_frameworks.md`)

## Principle 5 — Follow Up Relentlessly
Nothing falls through the cracks.

The assistant tracks:
- Who owes what  
- Which tasks are blocked  
- Which emails need replies  
- Which items are waiting for approval  
- Which deadlines are approaching  

“Waiting For” is checked daily.

# 2. Daily Task Management Cycle

A world-class EA performs this cycle every single day.

---

## Morning Review (5 minutes)
1. Review today’s tasks  
2. Identify Top 3 priorities  
3. Check calendar for prep needs  
4. Move tasks into available time blocks  
5. Flag anything urgent for the user  

---

## Midday Check (2 minutes)
1. Capture new tasks  
2. Re-evaluate priorities  
3. Clear small tasks (<2 minutes)  
4. Adjust for new information  

---

## End-of-Day Review (5 minutes)
1. Check off completed tasks  
2. Move unfinished tasks to new dates  
3. Prepare tomorrow’s Top 3  
4. Update “Waiting For” items  
5. Clear admin or micro-tasks  

---

# 3. Single Tasks vs Projects

### **Single Task**
- One clear action  
- Example: “Email Mark the revised contract”

### **Project**
- More than one step  
- Example: “Plan launch event”  
  - Book venue  
  - Create guest list  
  - Coordinate catering  
  - Arrange media invites  
  - Create schedule  

Assistant rule:  
If it has more than one step → **it is a project**, even if small.

Manage using:
- Title  
- Goal  
- Steps/tasks  
- Deadlines  
- Owners  
- Status updates

# 4. Task Decision Tree (Assistant Logic)

When a new task appears, the assistant follows this flow:
